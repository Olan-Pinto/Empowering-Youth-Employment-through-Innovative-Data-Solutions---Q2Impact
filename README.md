## **Project Overview**

This project aims to create a **data-driven web application** to bridge the gap between local businesses and young job seekers. The interactive platform provides insights into job opportunities, including current and expected vacancies, job types, and accessibility for youth. 

By connecting youth, businesses, and youth centers under the Ministry of Youth (MOY), this solution supports employment opportunities and fosters community development.
